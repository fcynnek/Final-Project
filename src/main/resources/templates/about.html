            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>The founder of PET-ME is a volunteer at the <a href="https://www.nycacc.org" target="_blank">NYC's Animal
                    Care Centers</a>
                where he started as a dog walker, adoption councelor, and outreach advocate. In 2020, when COVID-19
                affected
                opperations at
                the shelter, volunteers where not allowed to be in the premises to assist. He then started fostering and
                that
                was how he
                ended up adopting his pitbull dog, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theFrizziest/"
                    target="_blank">Miss
                    Frizzle</a> (named
                after the cartoon "The Magic School Bus").</p>

            <p>Once the pandemic was slightly under control and vaccines where more widely available, Kenny wanted to be
                closer to the community
                and assist in the areas most affected. He then switched roles to be an animal handler for the shelter's
                mobile
                vaccination clinics.
                An animal handler is the person who restrains the animal while the veterinary doctor administers the
                vaccines
                to the pet. This
                is to ensure that the animal does not attach nor bite any personnel during the vaccination. </p>

            <p>Surprisingly, he noticed that many of the pets would miss their annual (or bi-annual in some cases)
                vaccines.
                *Et voila* Why not
                create something that will help pet pawrents track and remind them of their pet's vaccines and
                medications? I
                mean... Us humans
                have Apple Health. So why not create the "Apple Health" equivalent for pets?</p>
